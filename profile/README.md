## ğŸ‘‹ â€¢ Overview

> Minestrap is a development team from Brazil focused on developing java and bedrock plugins, using **Pocketmine-MP** and **Spigot** API and implementing better and optimized plugins with open source for everyone! Our goal is to create plugins that are not yet in the community. We intend to create an expansive library for minecraft development and a unique website with interface templates that will help make development easier.
